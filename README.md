- `/nec minprofit <amount> ` - Set your minimum profit for flips.
- `/nec minpercent <amount> ` - Set your minimum percentage profit for flips.
- `/nec blacklist <add/remove> item ` - Blacklist a certain item from not showing up in flips. For example /nec blacklist add Hyperion where Ultimate Wise >= 1 will add Ultimate Wise 1 to 5, you can also use =, >, <, =< etc. Note that if you add an item and blacklist any instance of that item being found and then decide to start adding enchantments to it and so on you'll have to /nec blacklist remove Hyperion and then /nec blacklist add Hyperion where Ultimate Wise >= 1 etc.

Also other commands for stars / reforges:
/nec blacklist add Hyperion where stars >= 1
/nec blacklist add Hyperion where fabled
Same for remove.
- `/nec maxcost <amount> ` - Set the maximum buying price for a flip

# We are not liable for any coins you lost by buying items without checking, flips aren't always perfect
